## Purpose
A web application I created using React and Tailwind CSS with the goal of allowing musicians to train their aural skills by themselves for free.\
The tests in this project are modeled after the ear test portion of the Royal Conservatory of Music's Level 10 examination.\
This project is currently in the final stages of deployment, and I am preparing to expand user testing to music schools in Ontario.

## Features
This project currently contains interval training and chord identification training. Chord progression training is also coming soon, I'm currently finalizing the Soprano Alto and Tenor progression algorithms.\
These musical elements are generated at random and the user is tasked with listening and correctly identifying them, and is given feedback after each session.

## About Me
At the time of writing I'm currently a first year computer science student at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario.\
I decided to create this web application after seeing how few resources there were online for musicians to train their necessary aural skills.\
As for my musical background, I achieved my ARCT diploma in piano performance from the Royal Conservatory of Music in 2021. I used my deep understanding of music theory concepts to digitally represent notes, intervals, and chords in this project.

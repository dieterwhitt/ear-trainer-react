## Purpose
A web application I created using React with the goal of allowing musicians to train their aural skills by themselves for free.

## Features
Currently contains interval training and chord identification training. Chord progression training is also in the works.\
These musical elements are generated at random and the user is tasked with listening and correctly identifying them, and is given feedback after each session.

## About Me
At the time of writing I'm currently a first year computer science student at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario.\
I decided to create this web application after seeing how few resources there were online for musicians to train their necessary aural skills.\
As for my musical background, I achieved my ARCT diploma in piano performance from the Royal Conservatory of Music in 2021. I used my deep understanding of music theory concepts to digitally represent notes, intervals, and chords in this project.\
For more info on the implementation, feel free to look at the code or read the information in the next section.

## More Info
I'm planning on buying a domain to host this webapp when I add its final features and polish it.\
I'm also planning on creating a video demonstration for this project in the very near future.
